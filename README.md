# MyReads Project

## Overview

My project 6 for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree is a book tracker. You can track your reading by searching books (use the + icon at the bottom of the shelves). You can add your books to one of three shelves on the main page (or not). There are shelves for books you want to read, books you are reading now, and books you have read.

## Instructions

1. Download or clone the project to your computer 
`git clone https://github.com/lorio/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git`
2. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`
4. Search books by clicking the + button which takes you to a search input field. The page will fill with your results.
5. If the book is in the database, and your search term is in the data file (SEARCH_TERMS.md, you can call up a thumbnail with author and title information. If the book or book image is not in the data, the search field will empty for you to try another search.
6. Choose a shelf to put it on (Want to Read, Read, Currently Reading, or none) by selecting a choice of shelves from the dropdown menu at the bottom right corner of the book's thumbnail image.
7. when you open the app again, your can update it with your reading activity by selecting another bookshelf. 

## Dependencies
Starter files bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) are provided in the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree and other [Udacity courses and tracks](https://www.udacity.com/courses/all). Used [lodash.debounce](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.debounce),  and [React-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) to improve user experience.

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Additional Resources
Student forums on Slack, lessons, and a mentor session were helpful in completing this project. I also learned a lot from the excellent Udacity student Maeva's video walkthrough [study jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6L2jLHV9j8&feature=youtu.be) and from my first submission review.
